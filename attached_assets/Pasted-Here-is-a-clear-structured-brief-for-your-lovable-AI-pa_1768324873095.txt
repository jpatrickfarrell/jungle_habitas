Here is a clear, structured brief for your lovable AI page on barefootluxury.mx, built from everything you answered. You can give this to a designer/dev or use it to refine the concept.

1. Role and Goals of the AI
AI positioning: A super luxurious, warm-but-sophisticated “Barefoot Luxury Advisor” that speaks directly to high‑net‑worth buyers (US/Canada/Europe) wanting a Tulum home radically different from their dense city life.

Main goals:

Capture leads and pre‑qualify them (budget, preferred amenities, automation level).

Book on‑site visits and virtual calls.

Offer virtual tour scheduling and send curated projects that match the client’s “dream brief” (wellness features, room count, style).

2. Page Structure and Tabs
The AI should live as hero of the homepage of barefootluxury.mx, plus a dedicated page later (e.g., /concierge).

Suggested sections/tabs:

Hero + AI concierge

Minimal AI character representing “barefoot” walking through jungle/house.

Welcome message + first questions: dream, budget, timeline.

About Barefoot Luxury

Short story: boutique developer of 4–5 bedroom jungle houses near the ocean, low footprint, outdoor‑focused architecture, wellness features (plunge pools, saunas, red‑light rooms, retreats).

Emphasize: bespoke design, no two houses the same, 3D walkthrough process to align with client vision.

Houses & Projects

Grid or slider of current and past houses:

Price range: USD 500,000–1,000,000.

Features: private jungle paths, natural pools, wellness rooms, retreat‑ready layouts, walking/bike distance (~1 km) to ocean and restaurants/hotel zone.

AI can ask: “Do you prefer more privacy in the jungle or closer access to restaurants/beach?”

Investment & Return

Explain minimum investment (~USD 500–600k), positioning as lifestyle + asset.

AI asks about:

Purpose (lifestyle, rental, mixed).

Expected use (personal retreats, hosted retreats, pure investment).

Visit & Contact

AI guides user to:

Book physical visit (site + built houses).

Book video call/virtual tour.

Integrate: WhatsApp button + Calendly link + Odoo lead capture.

3. Visual Style and UX
References: Azulik Developments, Selva Dentro, Aura Habitat, Alma Huatulco, Nativa Playa, Cuatro Cuatros, Uxan Tulum (for mood, not to copy).

Palette: Sand beige + jungle green + white + natural wood + gold accents for luxury.

Hero vibe: Minimal, elegant AI character (barefoot silhouette or line‑art figure) that appears in:

The hero section.

As a small floating chat bubble on mobile.

Mobile-first:

Designed mainly for Instagram traffic on phones.

Very clear buttons: “Talk to Barefoot Advisor”, “Book Visit”, “See Available Houses”.

Avoid heavy text; use the AI to reveal details progressively.

4. Conversation Flow for the AI
Initial flow:

Warm welcome:

“Welcome to Barefoot Luxury in Tulum. Ready to discover a jungle home unlike anything you have back home?”

Qualification block (light but clear):

Desired budget range (starting at 500–600k).

Use preference: personal use, retreats, investment.

Priority features:

Wellness (plunge pool, sauna, red room, outdoor baths).

Automation/smart home.

Proximity (more jungle vs closer to restaurants/hotel zone).

Showcase block:

AI suggests 2–3 houses or concepts that fit.

Shows: a couple of renders, summary, key wellness features.

Option to:

“Book an on‑site visit”

“Schedule a video tour”

Lead capture block:

Name, email, WhatsApp.

Preferred date/time for visit or call.

AI explains that the sales director → sales manager → dedicated agent will follow up personally.

Follow‑up block:

Send recap: “Here is what you told us you’re dreaming of…”

Option to receive a PDF brochure or video link (generic now, real content later).

5. Technical and Integration Requirements
Platform: WordPress as main; AI/chat widget integrated via plugin or custom embed; keep option to mirror essentials in Squarespace if needed.

Integrations:

WhatsApp (click‑to‑chat with prefilled message from AI summary).

Calendly (or similar) for booking visits and calls.

Odoo CRM:

AI should send each qualified lead with tags: BUDGET, PURPOSE, PRIORITY FEATURES, LANGUAGE.

Dev needs: webhook/API endpoint from Odoo to push leads directly.

Content placeholders:

Use generic images and sample floorplans now (12 renders: rooms, bathrooms, living, kitchen, stairs, exteriors, pool, front, 3D plans, etc.).

Later you swap to real images, 3D tours, and 360° paths.

6. KPIs and Behavior
Target KPIs Q1 2026:

~30 qualified leads/month.

~8 physical visits/month.

~USD 2.2M in sales pipeline from barefootluxury.mx.

AI should be optimized to:

Reduce friction (few fields, more conversation).

Push towards visit/meeting booking rather than just info browsing.
